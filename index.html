										<h4>Assess yourself based on the global and differentiated models of self which were discussed to you.</h4>

										<p style="font-size: larger; color: #414141;">I would assess myself and other people using the Global model, since we should really examine a person’s totality or as a whole rather than breaking them down into parts like what the Differentiated model prefers us to do. In my perspective, you really could not break down a person to three parts through their id, ego, and superego; even if you attempt to, it is impossible to specify or label a person’s personality correctly, it may be easy to judge a person from what you only see but you’ll never know their position unless you could walk in their shoes.

									<h4>Which among the four great systems of eastern thought you think makes sense to you when it comes to understanding yourself? Give some examples.</h4>
									<p style="font-size: larger; color: #f2f2f2;">The eastern thought that makes more sense to me is from Hinduism, I like the idea that the 'Atman' or soul is the real self, which is distinct from our temporary bodies. It points out that Consciousness is a symptom of the soul, without it the body has no awareness. I would like to believe that there is a soul since it’s more calming to believe that there is one because of its relation to the presence of an afterlife; we were taught that when the body dies, the soul is the only one that remains. </p>

										<h4>Summarize the lesson about “The Self from the Psychological Perspective”</h4>
										<h6></h6>
										<p style="font-size: larger; color: #414141;">
											William James' Self Theory indicates that human beings individual perception can be divided into two, first is the capacity to be a thinking subject called the ‘I’, and second to be the object of one self’s thinking at the same time called the ‘Me’.
										</p>
										<p style="font-size: larger; color: #414141;">
											Carl Rogers’ Self Theory indicates that there is a ‘Real Self’ which is the one the person most identifies with, and an ‘Ideal Self’ the person who we want to be, and in order to have ‘Congruence’ the ideal self should be closer to the real self.
										</p>
										<p style="font-size: larger; color: #414141;">
											The Global Model is the principle that we should look at a person’s totality rather being broken down into parts. Differentiated Model in the other hand, is examining a person through its parts for it can be divisible or broken down into components.  
										</p>
										<p style="font-size: larger; color: #414141;">
											Albert Bandura’s Agentic Theory of the Self points out that selfhood is not culturally influence or controlled by urges, rather every human has the capability of thinking, controlling one’s action, and is free to decide by him or herself.
